# Overview

This project is for me to review Java skills that I aquired a few years ago but haven't used since. This project will be a great opportunity to practice using Java and implement basic OOP principles.

This software will act as a bill tracker application. This will be storing the data in a .dat file and users will have 6 actions.

1. Load the file
2. List all the bills saved
3. Add new bills
4. Edit existing bills
5. Delete bills
6. Quit the software

# Future Work

- Store info in a db rather than a file
- Enable better error handling
- Inlcude data validation for user input
- Provide more output to the user
